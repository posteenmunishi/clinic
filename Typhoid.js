      <h5>  Typhoid fever is an infection that causes diarrhea and a rash. It is most commonly caused by bacteria called Salmonella typhi (S typhi).
        Causes
S typhi is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.

Some people become carriers of S typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease.

Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.
